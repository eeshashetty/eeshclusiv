**Little Free Library** is a huge worldwide community, aiming to promote the "Take a book, leave a book" policy by setting up free libraries across the world. Mumbai has two LFLs - both in Andheri. Ananya and I decided to go visit both.

Both the libraries were so cute, and had a really nice collection of books. We dropped off some our own books and picked up some from there. The Versova library was near a really stretch, where we saw people painting murals and cats napping.

We ended the day with a nice bowl of Ramen!
