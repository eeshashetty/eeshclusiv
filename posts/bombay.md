Celebrated a family friend's 50th birthday with a staycation at the **Taj Palace Hotel**. A beautiful hotel with so much history and great architecture, and a really good breakfast buffet as well!

Spent the first night walking around South Bombay, and the next morning on a yacht ride on the Jetty. A wonderful experience, would definitely love to do this again.
